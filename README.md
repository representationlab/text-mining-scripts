# text-mining-scripts
This repository contains the following scripts for text mining:

1. [OCR with Pytesseract](https://github.com/representationlab/text-mining-scripts/blob/main/scripts/1-OCR%20with%20Pytesseract%20(Jupyter%20Notebook).ipynb): Perform optical character recognition on collection of scanned books and save results as text files.
2. [Segment and Disaggregate Texts](https://github.com/representationlab/text-mining-scripts/blob/main/scripts/2-Segment%20and%20Disaggregate%20Texts%20(Jupyter%20Notebook).ipynb): Section txt files into 1000-word chunks and transform into bag-of-words files (csv and txts).
3. [Cleaning and Basic Text Anaylsis](https://github.com/representationlab/text-mining-scripts/blob/main/scripts/3-Cleaning%20and%20Basic%20Text%20Analysis%20(Jupyter%20Notebook).ipynb): Remove punctuation, stopwords, non-English words and perform basic frequency counts, concordancing, and POS and NER tagging with NLTK and spaCy
4. [BookNLP](https://github.com/representationlab/text-mining-scripts/blob/main/scripts/4-BookNLP%20(Jupyter%20Notebook).ipynb): Run booknlp pipeline on collection of texts, store results as csv files and perform basic analyses.
5. [BERTopic Modeling](https://github.com/representationlab/text-mining-scripts/blob/main/scripts/5-BERTopic%20Modeling%20(Jupyter%20Notebook).ipynb): Perform topic modeling on texts using sentence transformers and visualize results.
